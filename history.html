       <h2> Our History</h2>
      <p >Founded in 2021 , Diversified Kenya is a grassroots queer community dedicated to creating a safe and
        supportive space for Lesbian, Bisexual, Queer, and Gender Non-Conforming (GNC) women in
        Kenya. Initially established as an advocacy group for LGBTQIA+ rights, the organization has evolved
        into a dynamic hub for queer youth empowerment, self-expression, and community-building. Rooted
        in African culture and art, Diversified Kenya fosters an environment of joy, love, and mental wellness,
        offering a sanctuary where LGBTQIA+ individuals can thrive despite prevalent socio-political
        challenges.</p>

            <h3> 200 Queers Hike</h3>
            <p>We organized a Successful queer hike, bringing together 200 vibrant individulals to explore
            breathtaking Kanunga Falls in Muranga County.
            </p>
            <p class="more-text">The event was filled with laughter, 
              camaraderie, and the shared joy of connecting with nature. 
              Hikers marveled at the serene beauty of the falls, with cascading 
              waters creating the perfect backdrop for relaxation and memorable 
              photos. From challenging trails to moments of reflection by the water,
               everyone found something to treasure. The sense of community and
                belonging was palpable, making it not just a hike but a celebration
                 of authenticity, adventure, and togetherness. A day well spent,
                  with memories to last a lifetime! </p>
