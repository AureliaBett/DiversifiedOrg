       <h2> Our History</h2>
      <p >Founded in 2021 , Diversified Kenya is a grassroots queer community dedicated to creating a safe and
        supportive space for Lesbian, Bisexual, Queer, and Gender Non-Conforming (GNC) women in
        Kenya. Initially established as an advocacy group for LGBTQIA+ rights, the organization has evolved
        into a dynamic hub for queer youth empowerment, self-expression, and community-building. Rooted
        in African culture and art, Diversified Kenya fosters an environment of joy, love, and mental wellness,
        offering a sanctuary where LGBTQIA+ individuals can thrive despite prevalent socio-political
        challenges.</p>
